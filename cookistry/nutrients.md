## Calories

Calories are energy!

## In-Depth

### Carbs

Sugar and Starch. Energyyy. You seem to not actually need those, provided you get your energy from somewhere else. 

Carbs contain 4 calories/gram. Lowcarb/ketogenic: only around 100g/day, otherwise around 300g.

Carbs have a Glycemic Index (GI). High GI ==> quick digestion and release into the bloodstream. Low GI is considered more healthy, and does not lead to a blood sugar spike, which would force the body to store the sudden influx of blood sugar somewhere else, e.g. in fat. Also, you avoid the crash after the sugar high.

### Protein

This is what we are made of, and we need it to rebuild. Can also be burned for energy because it contains calories. It is generally recommended that no more than 35% of calories come from protein. Recommended: 0.8g per kg of body weight (==> 56 g). But.

Proteins is made of some of the 22 amino acids, of which we need all. Thankfully, we only need 9, because we can build the others from those. Those are: Tryptophan (0.295g), Threonine (1.18g), Isoleucine (1.121g), Leucine (2.478g), Lysine (2.242g), Methionine and Cysteine (1.121g), Valine (1.416g), Phenylalanine and Tyrosine (1.947g), Histidine (0.826g).

### Fats

1g contains 9 calories. It is recommended that at least 20% of calories come from fats. There are saturated and unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats (such as in vegetable oil) are considered more healthy (although we are not sure anymore), because they do not lead to high levels of evil LDL cholesterol. 

Exceptions: trans fat is unsaturated but increases risk of heart diseases. It is found mostly in hydrogenerated vegetable oils and a little in animal fat. MTCs on the other hand are saturated fats believed to be healthy, promoting fat burning and decreasing appetite.

These are linoleic acid (LA) [fatty ω-6 acids], and α-linoleic acid (ALA) [fatty ω-3 acids]. I apparently need 12g of LA and 1.1g of ALA per day.

Apparently, ω-6/ω-3 should be 1:1 or even 1:4, to achieve this, ω-6 intake typically needs to decrease and/or ω-3 to increase.

### Fiber

Carbs we cannot digest, found mostly in plants, and we need it, both soluble and insoluble. About 14g of fiber per 1000 calories are needed.

### Vitamins and Minerals

Consume != absorb. Different forms might be better (potassium gluconate > potassium citrate), some compete (calcium, phosphorus) for absorption, something might hinder absorption (phytic acid). This is all still being discussed and difficult and argh!

## Things we do not really need

### Cholesterol

We can produce enough of this on our own.
