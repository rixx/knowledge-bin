# Writing scientific Papers

Information taken from "Studien-Arbeiten" by Jochen Ludewig et al.

## Preface

Economics decide where science goes (funding). That is generally neither good nor bad, but we have a moral obligation to examine every single use case before we approve of it. Scientific purity and objectivity is a legend. Do not trust.

Therefore: never just accept a topic as god-given, discuss its worth and meaning. And do never be arrogant towards other (non-scientific) disciplines.


## What is a scientific paper?

Stuff your university claims it to be. Read carefully, there may be shitloads of bollocks.

A paper in computer science must be scientific and should be useful. Since the topic is a given, examinees must mostly worry about being scientific.

### Dramatis Personae:

* *Examinee*: writes the paper
* *Examiner*: dictates the topic and judges the paper
* *Advisor*: somebody working for/with the examiner

### The scientific method

Well. [Science](http://hpmor.com).

## The component character of scientific achievements

Use everything there is (pre-existing knowledge), then add something on top or in between to further our knowledge (adding a novelty founded in our knowledge or complement our knowledge by adding in parts that were not quite known yet).

Do *not*: Just reproduce things other people had worked out already. Work on top of baseless premises, making your results unusable. Choose your topic so that no-one can really continue working on the subject. Gather together several pieces of older knowledge and present those. 

Have both breadth and depth.

Yes, you need to work independently, but you *are* allowed to ask questions. In fact, this is a god thing! Ask your advisor, that is what he is there for!


## Working scientificly

Activities: finding a topic & planning & checking & replanning, working with literature, work out requirements & implement software, write paper, present paper.

### Planning

**Finding a topic**: This is important. Do not underestimate. Find something you want to be known for. 

**Scheduling**: Work out requirements and an end date. Then make a plan (Gantt chart like). Check your scheduling with your advisor, obv. Include buffer intervals. Make appointments for regular meetings with your advisor. Check your progress regularly!

### Work structure

Good, clean, structured work space. Regular schedule for work and free time. 

Think of little, testable objectives! Always formulate your concrete objectives before you start working on something AND CHECK THOSE! Regularly. Objectives are useless if you have no reality check.

Working with pen and paper may work much better for you than anything else. Use the computer for a clean copy of your work and documentation. "A fool with a tool is still a fool."

### Working with literature

While working: first gather literature, then evaluate, then elaborate your own work. 

Do not rely too much on the internet, yada yada.

Start from relevant publications, especially newer ones, then go backwards through their bibliography. Instantly put those papers into your bibliographic collection. Just do it.

When finished: reduce drastically, try not to drown in literature, as sexy as that may sound ;). Use the PQ4R method to do so (chapter-for-chapter in longer works):
* *P*review: get bibliographical data and skim the text (captions, emph, figures).
* *Q*uestions: Write down questions you would like to answer with the help of this specific text.
* *R*ead: Read the text and try to answer your questions, either marking the answers or copying them from the text (with precise source citation!)
* *R*eflect: Look for objections, try to put the material in relation to things you know, find examples or counter examples
* *R*ecite: summarize the article out loud in your own words
* *R*eview: write a conclusive evaluation of the source (answered your questions? problems? critique? helpfulness?), put it in your bibliographical archive.

Needed for a bibliography is: 

type of publication | data necessary for finding | further data
--------------------|----------------------------|--------------
textbook            | author, title, edition     | publisher, place
journal article     | journal, year, page number, maybe journal number | auther, title
conference article  | publisher or series, name of conference, year, page | author, title


## Structure and Content

Actually, the paper is just the documentation of what you did. Do not forget that.

### Requirements and Objectives

Written for your readers. You need to win them over, and reading should not be any trouble for them and should provide them with new insights. Assume they are interested but know less about the topic than you. (aka: do not assume the reader to be like your advisor.)

So, the rules are:
* make clear who stands to profit from reading your paper and who does not
* provide easy access to your topic
* make reading as pleasant as possible, by form and content
* outline things as concisely as possible

### Components

* title page with all bibliographic data, abstract: truthfull and concise, include translation of abstract
* table of content (and tables, and figures): short and succinct captions, not more than one line, no abbr., two levels are enough
* task and scope
* overview over relevant literature, fundamentals: starting situation 
* approach: the most important part, not to be dominated by the following. Explain your approach, your reasoning, the alternatives etc.
* solution and explanation
* result and assessment: What you got, and what it is worth going from your initial position
* critical review: embed your results into the real world, document failed approaches etc
* appendices
* bibliography: last, save for an index (which is not relevant unless you write a book. Do not write a book.)

Code and Manuals are to be handed in separately.

### Order of writing

* Start with your bibliography. Do not be sloppy.
* You already got the task, scope and relevant fundamental literature. 
* Write your structure, the first layer in the table of contents
* Now work on your own approach, then the remainder. This might grow uncontrollably. Do not put loads of diagrams and code into your appendices, nobody is going to read that stuff. No code and documentation in your paper except for exemplary excerpts.
* Now revise your text. Do not shirk this.
* *Now* make a fine title page and abstact, including a translation in case your paper is not in English

### Forms of scientific statements

* Quotes: do not quote unread sources. Think twice before including quotes from sources of doubtful reputation. Only quote (as far as possible) generally accessible sources.
* Verified Fundamentals: Some things, you reeeeally do not have to quote (Peano on natural numbers). You need not quote the originators of those. Do not go too far, especially in computer science, there is not exactly a lot of verified common knowledge yet.
* Working hypothesis: Sometimes you make choices based on banal things, everything else being equal. Do embellish these.
* Measurements and experience: Do eeet.
* Deductions: Do it. Use 'I' as marker. You can come to negative conclusions, that is fine, too. 
* Arguments: make it easy to follow. If need be, repeat yourself.

### Language

Wolf Schneider. Tucholsky. That stuff. 

No using of stupid words. Be precise. Be concise. Good metaphors are ok. Do not use too many. One metaphor should be enough for everyone.

Substantivstil is for kleinkarierte paper pushers. Use verbs, they are alive.

Short sentences. Substantive clauses. Subordinate clauses for subordinate content. Repeating words yields clarity, do not avoid. Keep temporal structure (first … then … finally …).

Filler words are bad. Bad. Bad. Not mostly bad. Not slightly bad. Not seen as bad. Bad. 

Buzzwords. Oh, dear Dijkstra, don't get me started. Seriously, don't. 

And, yeah, everything. No need to write it down, hopefully: Just what Wolf Schneider says. And the usenet. Then you cannot go wrong.
