# Writing scientific Papers

Information taken from "Studien-Arbeiten" by Jochen Ludewig et al.

## Preface

Economics decide where science goes (funding). That is generally neither good nor bad, but we have a moral obligation to examine every single use case before we approve of it. Scientific purity and objectivity is a legend. Do not trust.

Therefore: never just accept a topic as god-given, discuss its worth and meaning. And do never be arrogant towards other (non-scientific) disciplines.


## What is a scientific paper?

Stuff your university claims it to be. Read carefully, there may be shitloads of bollocks.

A paper in computer science must be scientific and should be useful. Since the topic is a given, examinees must mostly worry about being scientific.

### Dramatis Personae:

* *Examinee*: writes the paper
* *Examiner*: dictates the topic and judges the paper
* *Advisor*: somebody working for/with the examiner

### The scientific method

Well. [Science](http://hpmor.com).

## The component character of scientific achievements

Use everything there is (pre-existing knowledge), then add something on top or in between to further our knowledge (adding a novelty founded in our knowledge or complement our knowledge by adding in parts that were not quite known yet).

Do *not*: Just reproduce things other people had worked out already. Work on top of baseless premises, making your results unusable. Choose your topic so that no-one can really continue working on the subject. Gather together several pieces of older knowledge and present those. 

Have both breadth and depth.

Yes, you need to work independently, but you *are* allowed to ask questions. In fact, this is a god thing! Ask your advisor, that is what he is there for!
