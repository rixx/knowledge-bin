# Writing scientific Papers

Information taken from "Studien-Arbeiten" by Jochen Ludewig et al.

## Preface

Economics decide where science goes (funding). That is generally neither good nor bad, but we have a moral obligation to examine every single use case before we approve of it. Scientific purity and objectivity is a legend. Do not trust.

Therefore: never just accept a topic as god-given, discuss its worth and meaning. And do never be arrogant towards other (non-scientific) disciplines.


## What is a scientific paper?

Stuff your university claims it to be. Read carefully, there may be shitloads of bollocks.

A paper in computer science must be scientific and should be useful. Since the topic is a given, examinees must mostly worry about being scientific.

### Dramatis Personae:

* *Examinee*: writes the paper
* *Examiner*: dictates the topic and judges the paper
* *Advisor*: somebody working for/with the examiner

### The scientific method

Well. [Science](http://hpmor.com).

## The component character of scientific achievements

Use everything there is (pre-existing knowledge), then add something on top or in between to further our knowledge (adding a novelty founded in our knowledge or complement our knowledge by adding in parts that were not quite known yet).

Do *not*: Just reproduce things other people had worked out already. Work on top of baseless premises, making your results unusable. Choose your topic so that no-one can really continue working on the subject. Gather together several pieces of older knowledge and present those. 

Have both breadth and depth.

Yes, you need to work independently, but you *are* allowed to ask questions. In fact, this is a god thing! Ask your advisor, that is what he is there for!


## Working scientificly

Activities: finding a topic & planning & checking & replanning, working with literature, work out requirements & implement software, write paper, present paper.

### Planning

**Finding a topic**: This is important. Do not underestimate. Find something you want to be known for. 

**Scheduling**: Work out requirements and an end date. Then make a plan (Gantt chart like). Check your scheduling with your advisor, obv. Include buffer intervals. Make appointments for regular meetings with your advisor. Check your progress regularly!

### Work structure

Good, clean, structured work space. Regular schedule for work and free time. 

Think of little, testable goals! Always formulate your concrete goals before you start working on something AND CHECK THOSE! Regularly. Goals are useless if you have no reality check.

Working with pen and paper may work much better for you than anything else. Use the computer for a clean copy of your work and documentation. "A fool with a tool is still a fool."

### Working with literature

While working: first gather literature, then evaluate, then elaborate your own work. 

Do not rely too much on the internet, yada yada.

Start from relevant publications, especially newer ones, then go backwards through their bibliography. Instantly put those papers into your bibliographic collection. Just do it.

When finished: reduce drastically, try not to drown in literature, as sexy as that may sound ;). Use the PQ4R method to do so (chapter-for-chapter in longer works):
* *P*review: get bibliographical data and skim the text (captions, emph, figures).
* *Q*uestions: Write down questions you would like to answer with the help of this specific text.
* *R*ead: Read the text and try to answer your questions, either marking the answers or copying them from the text (with precise source citation!)
* *R*eflect: Look for objections, try to put the material in relation to things you know, find examples or counter examples
* *R*ecite: summarize the article out loud in your own words
* *R*eview: write a conclusive evaluation of the source (answered your questions? problems? critique? helpfulness?), put it in your bibliographical archive.

Needed for a bibliography is: 

type of publication | data necessary for finding | further data
--------------------|----------------------------|--------------
textbook            | author, title, edition     | publisher, place
journal article     | journal, year, page number, maybe journal number | auther, title
conference article  | publisher or series, name of conference, year, page | author, title
